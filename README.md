# Web-CYOA-Airtable
This code is a blend of an Airtable RGB (D&D Style) and a code-only CYOA (handling special scenes). The code section, characters, involves rolling D&D Dice, and is associated with Batman characters. The theme for both is a bat cave. 
Use conditional logic to switch between the database version and the code subfolders.  Try to keep webhelper and styles in the parent, adding to the children only what only pertains to the children.  Note the use of ../ links in child folder to refer to parent files. Never have a function with the same name in the child and the parent, except for story - and never refer to ../story.js in the parent. 
The database associated with this repo is called RPG Airtable Live.
